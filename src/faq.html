        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Can I connect to the same person more than once?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>AbleFinder is programmed to prioritise matches with people you haven’t had the chance to chat with yet. How successful that is depends on a couple of things, including the number of potential matches (i.e., how big your parent community is), how many of them are online, and the speed at which your chat request is accepted. In most cases, you will not connect with the same person more than once, unless you choose to save them to your AbleFinder contacts list. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Is AbleFinder completely anonymous?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Relatively speaking. From your AbleFinder profile, your chat partners will be able to see your first name, Facebook profile photo, country that you’re in, and selection of age group and diagnosis, everything else is kept private and hidden. Unless you live in a small town and connect with your neighbour, you can be confident of your anonymity. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Does AbleFinder save my chat conversations?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Yes, AbleFinder de-identifies and then securely stores you chats for a very a good reason. In the event that a conversation is reported for inappropriate behaviour or safety concern, our team needs to be able to investigate and respond accordingly.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Am I really chatting with other parents just like me?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>AbleFinder uses clever technology to connect you with other parents whose AbleFinder profiles most closely match yours. This means that you can expect to be matched with someone whose child has the same diagnosis, is of a similar age, and ideally in the same city. Of course, if you want to connect with parents with a broader experience, you can always update your profile.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Can I be totally open and honest?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>AbleFinder enables you to connect privately and anonymously with other parents on similar journeys. To get the most out of your experience, we suggest being as open and honest as you feel comfortable being! That way, you can start building a network of people you have a real connection with, and whose advice and encouragement you trust.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Will I be judged for what I might say?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>We encourage our community members to be open and honest, which means that your chat partner might not always agree with what you say. We’re all for healthy discussion but take bullying very seriously! Chats reported for inappropriate behaviour or safety concerns are investigated by our team and responded to accordingly.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <div class="acc_toggle">Do I have to accept every chat request?</div>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Not at all! AbleFinder is designed to work in and around your lifestyle. If you get a chat request but don’t have time to chat, just select “Not Available”. That way, AbleFinder will know to pass on the request to other appropriately matched community members.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">How long do the conversations last?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>That’s completely up to you! If you or you chat partner stops responding, AbleFinder will end the conversation after 30 minutes. Otherwise, there is no limit to how long your conversation lasts.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Is translation available?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Right now, AbleFinder only supports English language but we are working on introducing a real-time translation feature so that AbleFinder is accessible in all languages.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">If there’s someone I get on well with, can I chat with them again?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Definitely! If you have a great chat, you can choose to save that person to your AbleFinder contact list so that you can easily connect with them again.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Can I talk to parents of children with other diagnoses?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Yes - you can update your profile to include additional diagnoses and age groups. That way, AbleFinder will connect you with other parents who may have a different experience from your own.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="acc_section acc_wrapper">
        <h4 class="acc_toggle">Does my child need to have an official diagnosis?</h4>
        <div class="acc_content">
          <p>Not at all. In this case we suggest selecting one or more diagnoses that have similar presentations to what your child is experiencing. You can always update these later.</p>

            <p>My name is Charlie. I am two years old and I have Down syndrome. I just recently became a big sister, which makes me the middle child and I love it!</p><p>I have two dogs that I enjoy slipping my snacks to and I love playing soccer. I can kick the ball around and I&rsquo;m even working on kicking it into the goal. I enjoy going to the beach to build sandcastles and splashing through the waves and I absolutely love the pool! I don&rsquo;t quite know how to swim yet but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from trying even though it makes my mom nervous. I also really love music and will dance and sing along to any country song that&rsquo;s on.</p><p>I am growing to become a self advocate with help from my parents. I enjoy meeting new friends and educating them on everything that makes me me and not just a diagnosis.</p>

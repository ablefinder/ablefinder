            <p>Zoey is our fourth biological child and gave us all the biggest surprise by sporting an extra chromosome (she has Down syndrome) as well as being born with a congenital heart defect.  The first year was hard, with five weeks in the NICU and open heart surgery - but through it all we could see that Zoey was a shining light in this world!</p><p>Zoey amazes us and inspires us, she’s the reason we decided that if we ever adopted (a long time dream of mine) we wanted to adopt a child with Down syndrome.  Ruby joined our family at the age of five, also sporting an extra chromosome and CHD!</p><p>We are so blessed to have these girls in our lives!  We are all better because of them and I can’t imagine our family any other way!!</p>

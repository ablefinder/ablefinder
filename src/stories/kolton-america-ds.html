            <p>We didn't know that Kolton was rocking an extra chromosome until he was 2 days old. When the doctor brought it up to us we went through a whirlwind of emotions. Mostly fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what his future would hold. When we look at him now that fear has vanished.</p><p>Kolton has a laugh and a smile that can light up any room. He continues to blow us away with all that he does. I never knew I wanted a child with Down Syndrome until I got one! I'm laying my claim to this, to Kolton, his extra chromosome and the little extra it carries with it! Laying my claim with the good days and the hard days that have come and those that have yet to come. I'm laying these claims full hearted, I never knew I wanted a child with Down Syndrome until I got one!</p>

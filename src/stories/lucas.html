            <p>Lucas is already 13 years old and just went to winter camp for the first time alone. We received so many comments from people who were with him at camp and it was AMAZING to hear that everyone saw in him what we do - a cheerful, positive, respectful, affectionate, active, and energetic child!</p><p>Wherever Lucas is, people want to be with him. He definitely doesn’t go unnoticed!</p><p>What makes him the able person he is?</p><p>I think it’s his desire to try new things and persevere in things that are difficult for him.</p>

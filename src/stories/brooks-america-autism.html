            <p>Brooks is our 5 year old son who happens to have Autism. This means Brooks has to work harder than some other children, but this has turned him into a fighter and one determined little boy! We could not possibly be more proud of him.</p><p>Brooks is our best teacher and greatest inspiration. He has taught us about patience, strength, and resilience. There are struggles and there are triumphs, but one of the many things Brooks continues to remind us of is to find absolute joy in even the simplest of moments, and that is a very beautiful thing!</p>

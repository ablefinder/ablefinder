            <p>My name is Ella, I was born with a rare genetic disease called Cystic Fibrosis. I was the first baby in my state to be diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis by the newborn screening.</p><p>I was diagnosed at 6 days old, my parents were scared, but with God’s help He has kept me extremely healthy and thriving!</p><p>I refuse to listen to the “norm” of Cystic Fibrosis, but instead I go against the grain.</p><p>  I am a strong, goal driven runner and gymnast that won’t just give up at a bump in the road! My goal is to inspire others to stand tall, push through, and work harder every day to be the best person you can be without listening to the boundaries or obstacles of a disease or illness!</p>

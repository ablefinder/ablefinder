            <i itemprop="description">Down syndrome</i>
            <p>Chloe is 5 years old, has gorgeous long hair, blue eyes and has lost 2 baby teeth so far. She LOVES to play with her dolls, and dressing up like a Disney princess! Her favourite colour is blue, she has Down Syndrome, and loves sausages and pizza! Chloe also goes to dance classes (ballet, Pom &amp; lyrical) and she is also a signed model and actress. She sings literally all of the time, and enjoys going to school.</p><p>See the words Down syndrome? See how small they look in that description of Chloe? See how those words are just a small part of Chloe, and NOT a definition of who she is?</p>

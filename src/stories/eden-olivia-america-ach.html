            <p>This is Eden Olivia. She has a type of Dwarfism called Achondroplasia. Her bones are shorter than yours and she will never be as tall as you are. However, she&rsquo;s capable of doing most of the things that you do, just maybe in a different way - her way. She&rsquo;s also capable of doing things that you can&rsquo;t.</p><p>We enjoy and appreciate all the support and love that we receive. What we don&rsquo;t need is sympathy. My child is a masterpiece, something to be celebrated and not pitied. Eden is a free spirit. Beyond her years, she is a sassy, adventurous, loving, wise, and beautiful two year old. To know her is to love her and to understand our journey with Achondroplasia.</p>

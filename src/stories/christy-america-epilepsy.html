            <i itemprop="description">Epilepsy</i>
            <p>I was diagnosed with Epilepsy at 15. It was hands down the most heartbreaking moment of my life. It was the moment I found out I was different. The moment I found out I would never drive or live alone. At 15 my life felt like it was over before it even began.</p><p>Fast forward to today. I have a daughter, she&rsquo;s the light of my life ( I know that sounds cliche but it&rsquo;s true) without her or the support of all the loving people in my life I wouldn&rsquo;t have done half of what i&rsquo;ve done. White water rafting, Vegas, Go Karting. I also teach children with Autism. To others this may seem like average milestones but to me they&rsquo;re everything and i&rsquo;m just getting started.</p>

            <i itemprop="description">Down syndrome</i>
            <p>Cora enjoys being a model and has worked for some huge brands, but she takes it all in her stride and loves the attention. She is a real people person and is popular in school. She adores her friends and loves to make them smile.</p><p>Cora does have support in school, but this is to adapt the work to meet her learning needs, she is otherwise coping well in mainstream education. She also attends dance and tennis classes, and loves to read, which she does so beautifully!</p><p>We are very lucky to have the most wonderful families who treasure Cora. She and her brother really are the best of friends!</p>

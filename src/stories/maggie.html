            <p>Maggie was born with an upper limb difference, her right arm ends slightly below her elbow.</p><p>She amazes us everyday with her ability to adapt and just live her life like any other active toddler, running around, playing and getting into mischief.</p><p>As parents, finding out about her difference was scary but as she has grown we've realized that she will almost always figure out new tasks in her own way, in her own time, if not we are there to support her.</p>

            <i itemprop="description">Muscular Dystrophy</i>
            <p>I was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I received my bachelor’s degree in Fashion Design and Merchandising and then furthered my education in getting my Master’s degree in Business.</p><p>I was diagnosed at age 24 with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (MD). </p><p>Living with MD has made me realize how strong I am. Sometimes I get stares because people wonder what a young girl like me is doing walking with a cane, or parking in a handicap parking spot, but I don’t mind. </p><p>Although my MD has progressed over the years, I have learned to accept it and make certain changes in to my life to help keep my balance and not fall. At this point I am just taking everything day by day and staying strong. But there’s one thing I want people to know by reading this.</p><p>Never, ever underestimate the power of your desire. If you want to live badly enough, you can live.</p>

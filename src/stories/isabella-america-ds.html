            <p>Isabella has truly been a light in our lives. She has overcome so many obstacles and broken down so many barriers that were put there by others. She has shown our family an unconditional love and patience that we didn&rsquo;t know we had. She is determined and curious about everything about the world.</p><p>Isabella is 2 years old now and beginning to take independent steps and yes it may have taken her a little longer to learn to walk or to talk than typical children her age but she did it! And she did it at her own pace and on her own time with the help of all her wonderful therapists. Isabella, I can't describe the love I feel when I look into you beautiful soul. You, my dear, are a light in our lives!</p>

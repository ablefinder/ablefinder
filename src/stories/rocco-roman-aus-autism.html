            <p>Rocco is almost 5 and Roman is 2.5, both boys have Autism, Global Development Delay, Sensory Processing Disorder and are both completely non verbal. Rocco was also recently diagnosed with Dyspraxia.</p><p>Despite all those difficulties, they have such a strong understanding of each other which is the foundation of their beautiful bond. They are so different, yet so alike! Their positivity and determination is admirable, their smiles and laughter light up our homes and our hearts. I know it sounds cliche&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;m a better person because of them, they have given me patience and positivity and changed how I see the world. They make this world a better place.</p>

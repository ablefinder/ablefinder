            <p>When Caleb was born, we had no idea what life with a “difference” would mean for us, and for him. Since that time, eleven years ago, we’ve not only discovered that people with special needs can be more similar than different, but we’ve also figured out that different is wonderful! How boring would life be if we were all the same?</p><p>Caleb has taught us many things – empathy, deeper friendships, what true inclusion means, patience, and joy. He lives in the moment and treasures each day. He has limitations, certainly, but we’ve found that focusing on his abilities will help him reach the stars.</p>

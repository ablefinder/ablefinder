            <p>Meet Kaid. He is a burst of energy wrapped in an angel face that you shouldn't let fool you!</p><p>Kaid is a character. Kaid is like nobody I've ever known. He is unique in every sense of the word and he wouldn't be Kaid without all the idiosyncrasies that make him who he is. His paediatrician has come to call them 'Kaidisms' and I love that.</p><p>Kaid has many diagnoses. Despite these he has continued to develop in his own way at his own pace and still loves life! He is my hero in every way.</p>

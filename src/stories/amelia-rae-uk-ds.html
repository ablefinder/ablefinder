            <i itemprop="description">Down syndrome</i>
            <p>On the 13th June 2017 Amelia-Rae come into our lives, with the surprise diagnosis of Down Syndrome. Seventeen months later, she&rsquo;s a typical toddler, who is not defined by her diagnosis.</p><p>She is already walking with just a little bit of support from us, talking in her own little way from the second she wakes up in the morning until she goes to bed at night, and she keeps everyone on their toes with her mischievous ways. Amelia loves to go to soft play and cause mayhem with the toys and other children, and at home she is a demanding and stubborn little madam who will only do what she wants when she wants.</p><p>Yes we do have to work extra hard everyday to achieve milestones; but this means every little one is celebrated and seen as an exciting and huge achievement.</p>

            <p>Although our journey with Down Syndrome has not been long, Addi has taught us so much! Her smiles and laughter will brighten a room, and her blowing raspberries makes everyone gush! She has taught us more about advocating than we ever could have thought.</p><p>Addi has taught us patience while we work through therapies, and so much joy and celebration when we hit milestones. She has taught us to look at life with a different lens and I couldn&rsquo;t imagine our life any different!</p><p>I cannot wait to see the amazing things Addi will do and be by her side cheerleading her on all the way!</p>

            <p>This is my Warrior, my best friend Keldan.  He has the happiest soul and has completed our family perfectly. Keldan was born with an extra chromosome which means he has extra smiles, extra love and extra kindness.</p><p>He is taking his time when hitting milestones which is fine as it just means there even more special when he does. He is such a delight to raise and I most certainly wouldn't change a thing about him.</p><p>Our motto in life is now 'In a world where you can be anything, Be kind'</p>

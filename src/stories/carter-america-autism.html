            <p>Meet Carter. He is a 6 year old boy, who happens to have autism. He is SO much more than that diagnosis, though.</p><p>Carter is funny. He is smart. He is caring and loving. He loves pirates...and even thinks he is one. Most people who meet Carter, all agree on one thing. He&rsquo;s happy. He&rsquo;s always laughing and smiling, and just making the world around him a better place. That happiness...is all that matters.</p><p>As a mom, I threw what was &ldquo;normal&rdquo; out the window a long time ago. I don&rsquo;t care what the world says is typical. We encourage Carter to be himself. I will spend everyday for the rest of my life trying to show people the beauty that is Carter. And working to get them to accept OUR normal. Autism doesn&rsquo;t define...my silly pirate.</p>

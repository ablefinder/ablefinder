            <i itemprop="description">Rare Chromosome Deletion</i>
            <p>Our sweet Declan ( Dex for short ) was born with a rare chromosome deletion.</p><p>When we first heard and read about the diagnosis it was mostly negative and told of all the things he wouldn't be able to do. Through lots of prayer a sheer determination we knew he would overcome so much.</p><p>Dex is walking, talking, jumping, learning, riding a bike and a host of other skills that we were told may not happen for him. We've learned that just because something is written and published, it is not the end all be all.</p><p>Dex is a prime and beautiful example of what can happen when you are surrounded by love and an amazing village of supportive people. He is worthy and able!</p>

            <p>Our sweet Damian is the definition of a miracle. He survived a number of massive strokes before he was even born, which caused Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy. At 5 months old he developed severe epilepsy and just had brain surgery to disconnect the entire left hemisphere of his brain.</p><p>Despite everything he goes through, Damian faces life with a smile on his face. He is a ray of sunshine and his smile can brighten anyone&rsquo;s day! Damian loves to cuddle and play with his two big brothers. He is adored by our entire family.</p>

            <p>This beautiful boy is Mason Dean and he was diagnosed with Autism at 4 years old. He is now 8 years old, and we have come so incredibly far, thanks to his hard work and determination that he puts in daily.</p><p>He is the silliest, sweetest, most loving little boy I have ever met and everyone who is so lucky to meet him adores him instantly. He loves to laugh and play, and we absolutely live for his daily cuddles and requests for &ldquo;hugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tickles.&rdquo; His little brother who is 14 months younger than him is his absolute best friend and it is so amazing to watch this little boy grow up and LOVE life and all those around him.</p><p>We are so incredibly proud of our Mason.</p>

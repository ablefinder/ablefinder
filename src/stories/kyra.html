            <i itemprop="description">Cerebral Palsy</i>
            <p>Kyra was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy at 13 months. The doctors limited her by saying ‘she might walk with aids, or not walk at all’, they further went on about  how limited she would be. But here she is, in all her glory defining her own limits. </p><p>She can jump, ride a bicycle, she can engage you in an interesting conversation and she is funny as well. Her love for books will astound you. Her creative fashion will amuse you. She is everyday defining herself and setting her own limits. Don’t let others define who you are. There’s no dis- in her ability. She is able and capable in every way.</p>

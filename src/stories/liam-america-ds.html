            <p>This is Liam! His smile is infectious! His personality as big as the earth! He doesn&rsquo;t meet a stranger and is full of hugs and handshakes. Liam is polite and friendly and able to do anything he sets his mind to.</p><p>He loves to swim, participate in his run club and choir, and do anything any other 6 year old boy does. He is currently in 1st grade and is impressing his father and me everyday with all he is learning.</p><p>My favorite part of the day with Liam is the morning. Every morning he greets me with a giant hug and a &ldquo;Hi Mom&rdquo; in the sweetest voice I&rsquo;ve heard. I&rsquo;m honored to be his mom!</p>

            <i itemprop="description">Verbal dyspraxia</i>
            <p>I was born with a neurological speech condition called Verbal Dyspraxia (Apraxia). I had years of intensive speech therapy to find a voice that others could understand. I am now at college doing a Childcare and Education course in a bid to fulfill my dream of supporting others who need additional support in school, just like me.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t let my diagnosis define me or stop me from following my dreams. Living with verbal dyspraxia has moulded me into the person I am today. I had to fight for my &lsquo;voice&rsquo; and I am determined that it will be heard, for others who share my diagnosis now and in the future.</p>

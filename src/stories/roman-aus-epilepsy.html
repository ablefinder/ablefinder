            <p>This is Roman. He's my adventurous, curious, spunky, and lovely little boy. He was diagnosed with epilepsy 3 weeks before his 3rd birthday, and although he has gone through so much this past year, he still wakes up each morning with a huge smile on his face.</p><p>Roman is radiant and full of life and he lights up the room with his laughter. He amazes me each and every day with his courage and determination, and I know he is going to continue to move mountains.</p>

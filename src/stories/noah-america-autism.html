            <p>Noah just radiates joy and has the most contagious smile. We are proud of him in every way, and he makes us so, so happy. And when I look at him, or pictures or videos of him, I don't see autism. I see a silly kid. A loved kid. A happy kid. A happy family. And as a parent, that is all that has ever really mattered.</p><p>My kid is so much more than his diagnosis or his struggles. And I've said this before, but raising Noah has completely changed me as a person. I didn't choose this life, this life chose me. But what a life it is.</p>

            <h3>Terms of Service – AbleFinder Pty. Ltd.</h3>
            <p>Welcome to AbleFinder!</p>
            <p>These Terms govern your use of AbleFinder and the products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we offer (the AbleFinder Products of Products), except where we expressly state that separate Terms (and not these) apply.</p>
            <ol>
               <li>
               <b>Our Services.</b>
               <p>Our mission is to ensure that every parent and primary carer of a child with disability feels connected, understood, and empowered. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <b>Provide a personalised experience for you.</b>
                     <p>Your experience on AbleFinder is unlike anyone else’s: from the connections, conversations and other content that you see in Blog Feed or other features that you might use, such as My Contacts, Library and Search. We use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you do on and off our Products - to personalise your experience.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Connect you with people that you care about.</b>
                     <p>We help you find and connect with people that matter to you across the AbleFinder Products you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others - for example, people you may want to become friends with and content that you might be interested in. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you.</b>
                     <p>There are many ways to express yourself on AbleFinder and to communicate with friends and others about what matters to you - for example, sending text and audio messages, photos, videos, or adding content to your profile. We also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology and share more expressive and engaging content on AbleFinder.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community.</b>
                     <p>People will only build a support network on AbleFinder if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct toward others and situations where we may be able to support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data across our AbleFinder Products when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone.</b>
                     <p>We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning systems so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abuse and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Research ways to make our services better.</b>
                     <p>We engage in research and collaborate with others to improve our Products. One way we do this is by analysing the data we have and understanding how people use our Products. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Provide consistent and seamless experiences across AbleFinder Products. </b>
                     <p>Our Products help you find and connect with people and content that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different AbleFinder Products that you use. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Enable global access to our services. </b>
                     <p>To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centres and systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be operated or controlled by AbleFinder Pty. Ltd. or its affiliates. </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               </li>
               <li><b>Our Data Policy and your privacy choices</b>
               <p>To provide these services, we must collect and use your personal data. We detail our practices in the Data Policy, which you must agree to in order to use our Products,</p></li>
               <li><b>Your commitments to AbleFinder and our community.</b>
               <p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:</p>
               <p><b>(a) Who can use AbleFinder</b></p>
               <p>When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For that reason, you must:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</li>
                  <li>Provide accurate information about yourself.</li>
                  <li>Create only one account (your own).</li>
                  <li>Not share your password, give access to you AbleFinder account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).</li>
               </ul>
               <p>We try to make AbleFinder broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use AbleFinder if</p
                  >
                  <ul>
                     <li>You are under 18 years old.</li>
                     <li>You are a convicted sex offender.</li>
                     <li>We previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms and Policies.</li>
                     <li>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.</li>
                  </ul>
               <p><b>(b) What you can share and do on AbleFinder</b></p>
               <p>We want people to use AbleFinder to express themselves and to engage with content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):</p>
               <p>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>That breaches these Terms, our Community Standards and other Terms and Policies that apply to your use of AbleFinder.</li>
                  <li>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</li>
                  <li>That infringes or breaches someone else’s rights.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>We may take action against your account, for the reasons described below. We may also disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights.</p>
               <p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe breaches your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our Terms and Policies.</p>
               <p><b>(b) The permissions you give us.</b></p>
               <p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:</p>
               <p>Permission to use content that you create and share:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>You own the content that you create and share on AbleFinder Products and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights that you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.</li>
                  <li>Specifically, when you post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (e.g., photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on AbleFinder, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other AbleFinder Products that you use. </li>
                  <li>You can end the license any time by deleting your content or account. You should know that, for technical reasons, any content that you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Permission to update software that you use or download:</p>
               <p>If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance and further develop it.</p>
               <p><b>(c) Limits on using our intellectual property</b></p>
               <p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or similar marks) with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us. </p>
               </li>
               <li><p><b>Additional provisions.</b></p>
               <p><b>(a) Updating our Terms.</b></p>
               <p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update the Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products. </p>
               <p>We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be part of the AbleFinder community, you can delete your account at any time.</p>
               <p><b>(b) Account suspension or termination.</b></p>
               <p>We want AbleFinder to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas. </p>
               <p>If we determine that you have violated our terms and policies, we may take action against your account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for use or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try to access it. </p>
               <p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place.</p>
               <p><b>(c) Limits on liability.</b></p>
               <p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our products, however, are provided “as is”, and we make no guarantees that they will always be safe, secure or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content that they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content). </p>
               <p>We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstances will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the AbleFinder Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. </p>
               <p><b>(d) Disputes.</b></p>
               <p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it’s useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.</p>
               <p>If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us, which arises out of or relates to these Terms or the AbleFinder Products (“claim”), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the Supreme Court of New South Wales or in the Federal Court of Australia, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of New South Wales will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
               <p><b>(d) Other.</b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and AbleFinder Pty. Ltd., regarding your use of our products. They supersede any prior agreements.</li>
                  <li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. To the extent that any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.</li>
                  <li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.</li>
                  <li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.</li>
                  <li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</li>
                  <li>You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life). </li>
                  <li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know that we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</li>
                  <li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
               </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
               <p><b>Other Terms and Policies that may apply to you.</b></p>
               <p>Community Standards: These guidelines outline our standards regarding the content that you post to AbleFinder and your activity on AbleFinder and other Products.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Safety: people need to feel safe in order to build their support network. We are committed to removing content that encourages real-world harm, including (but not limited to) physical, financial and emotional injury. </li>
                  <li>Voice: our mission is all about embracing diverse views. We err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it objectionable, unless removing that content can prevent a specific harm. </li>
                  <li>Equity: everyone on AbleFinder plays a part in keeping the platform safe and respectful. We ask people to share responsibly and let us know when they see something that may breach our Community Standards. We make it easy for people to report potentially breaching content. We also give people the option to block people so that they can control their own experience on AbleFinder. The consequences for breaching our Community Standards vary depending on the severity of the breach and a person’s history on the platform. For instance, we may warn someone for a first time breach, but if they continue to breach our policies, we may restrict their ability to connect on AbleFinder or disable their profile. We may also notify law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety. </li>
               </ul>

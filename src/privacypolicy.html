            </ul>
            <p><b>Communicate with you.</b></p>
            <ul><li> We use the information that we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products and let you know about our Policies and Terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</li></ul>

For example, an Early Intervention Centre looking to understand the support needs of their clients and local community. We don’t share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.</li>
               <li><p><b>Measurement partners.</b></p>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.</li>
               <li><p><b>Vendors and service providers.</b></p>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.

               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li><p><b>How do the AbleFinder Messenger Chatbot and App work together?</b></p>
            <p>AbleFinder’s Messenger Chatbot and App share infrastructure, systems and technology to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent, and safe experience. We also process information about you across AbleFinder Products for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from the Messenger Chatbot about accounts engaged in misconduct so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on the App. We also work to understand how people use and interact with AbleFinder Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different AbleFinder Products.</p>
         </li>
         <li><p><b>How can I manage or delete information about me?</b></p>
            <p>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify and delete your data. Learn more about your Ablefinder settings.</p>
            <p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Products or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first.

            <p>When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your conversations and photos, and you won’t be able to recover this information later. If you don’t want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead.</p>
         </li>
         <li><p><b>How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</b></p>
            <p>We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>In response to a legal request (e.g., a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of Europe when we have good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with Internationally recognised standards.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Information that we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with AbleFinder Products) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations of possible violations of our Terms or Policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term violations for at least a year to prevent abuse or other term violations.</p>
         </li>
         <li><p><b>How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</b></p>
            <p>We share information globally, both internally within AbleFinder Products, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred our transmitted to, or stored and processed in Europe or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the AbleFinder Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilise standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to Europe and other countries.</p>
         </li>
         <li><p><b>How will we notify you of changes to this Policy?</b></p>
            <p>We’ll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised Policy before you choose to continue using our products.</p>

        Before I purchased the d.light, I was using a kerosene lantern. I used to spend a lot of money on kerosene, and
        there was always so much smoke. My children would cry because of the smoke in the house. There is a real change
        with the d.light. I am able to save a lot and there is no smoke. I am happy; my children are happy.
      </p>

        The d.light is more convenient, so easy and not too costly. The first time I used it I thought it was
        miraculous. It was such a small light but it lit up a very large room. It created much more light than the
        kerosene lantern.

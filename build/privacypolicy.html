            <p>This Privacy Policy <strong>(Policy)</strong> describes how AbleFinder Pty Ltd <strong>("we", ”our" or "us")</strong> collects, handles and protects the privacy of your personal information.</p>
            <p>We have developed an app  and associated website that connects the parents of children with disabilities with each other in order to facilitate information sharing that supports and enhances the health, wellbeing, capacity and resilience of families and carers <strong>(App)</strong>. Parents can match based on commonalities such as diagnostic journey, age group and shared interests. The purpose of the App is to provide a platform where parents can access unbiased, targeted resources and be part of a network that informs, unites and ultimately empowers the members of the disability community.</p>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and understand the importance of protecting your personal information that is collected through the  provision of our services. This Policy outlines:
